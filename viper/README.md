# Viper Binary Analysis and Management Framework

This Dockerfile represents a Docker image that encapsulates the [Viper][1] binary analysis and management framework by Claudio Guarnieri ([@botherder][2] - [homepage][3]).

To run this image after installing Docker, use a command like this to launch the docker, replacing "~/workdir" with the path to the location of the data to analyse:

    sudo docker run -it --rm -v ~/workdir:/home/nonroot/workdir remnux/viper

To run the 'clamav' plugin, the clamav-daemon must be running. You can enable this by running:

    sudo service clamav-daemon start

Before running Viper, create the  ~/workdir and make it world-accessible ("`chmod a+xwr`").
