One aspect of the REMnux project involves providing [Docker images of popular malware analysis tools](https://remnux.org/docs/containers/malware-analysis/), with the goal of allowing investigators to conveniently utilize difficult-to-install applications without having to install the REMnux distro. You and [download and run existing images](https://remnux.org/docs/containers/run-apps/) and [contribute your own](https://remnux.org/docs/containers/create-docker-images/) to the REMnux collection.

This Github repository hosts the Dockerfiles themselves. The resulting images are built and hosted at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/remnux/).
